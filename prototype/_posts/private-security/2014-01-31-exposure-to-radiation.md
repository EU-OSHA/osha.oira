The use of equipment which generates radiation or working in areas close to
radiation sources entails a risk of tissue being destroyed and/or irreversible
effects on health. The risk level varies according to the dose of radiation
absorbed.

This risk is specific to certain jobs where X-ray machines are used: access
control (airports, public buildings, etc.) or the screening of mail, packages,
suitcases, etc. However, it also affects guards who, during their rounds in
hospitals, nuclear power plants, etc. may enter monitored or secure areas.

Risk factors:

\- Scanners - X-ray devices: faulty devices, inappropriate use.

\- The security guard: not (properly) trained, not aware of the risks

The effects of radiation can be hereditary. Over a certain radiation
threshold, there may be short-term effects relating to cell lesions: the
tissue most vulnerable to radiation is reproductive tissue, tissue involved in
the development of blood cells, etc.
