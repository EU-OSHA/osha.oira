Emotional workload relates to the emotional reactions experienced when working
in circumstances and conditions which are less than ideal or perceived as
unsuitable.

In some jobs the security guard´s work involving interaction with other
people. In their contact with the public they have to be constantly
accessible, constantly use polite language, alway project a professional
image, have a pleasant and polite manner, be friendly without being too
informal, efficient but not overzealous, etc.

This constant need to make "a good impression" and to "keep the right
distance" with the person you are dealing with is not something which comes
naturally to everyone. This "relational" aspect of the job therefore requires
control over the emotions (emotional behaviour skills), i.e. comprehension,
assessment and management of your own emotions as well as those of others.
This can entail a very significant emotional workload, which is often
minimized but can have a major impact on the worker´s wellbeing.
