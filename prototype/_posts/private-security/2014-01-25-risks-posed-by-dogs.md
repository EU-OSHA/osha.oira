Dogs can cause slight injuries such as lesions, light traumas (scratches,
bruises) and serious injuries such as bites, etc. They may also be a carrier
of infections, allergies or viruses.

Risk factors:

\- The dog : badly trained, too aggressive, sick, unpredictable behaviour.

\- Bad dog handling: several dog handlers for one and the same dog, different
command patterns depending on the individualÂ´s role, poor living conditions,
food and monitoring of the health of the animal (vaccinations, regular medical
check-ups).

\- The dog-handler: untrained or poorly trained as a dog handler, lack of
compliance with basic hygiene regulations, lack of care for the dog, aggresive
or unsuitable behaviour towards the dog.
