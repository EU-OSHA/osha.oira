Every job requires the use of energy to a lesser or a greater extent. The
activation of the necessary strenght to do the work requires the use of
muscles. Depending on the way in which these are used the job is considered to
be static or dynamic and will have a specific impact on the security officerÂ´s
health.

The risk factors related to physical workload are primarily linked to:

\- Forcer or inadequate working postures

\- Manual handling of loads

\- Moving around

\- Shift work, night work
