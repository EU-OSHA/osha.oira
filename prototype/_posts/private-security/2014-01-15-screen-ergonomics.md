Prolonged periods of working while sitting down may cause muscular pain in the
upper part of the back, the shoulders, arms, etc. This can be linked to a bad
postion in front of screens or monitors and can aslo lead to awkward movemtns,
trapped nerves, etc.

This kind of seated working environment is often linked to problems relating
to sedentary work (lower back pains, blood circulation disorders in the legs)
and to obesity. However, it can also cause eyestrain and other sight problems
because often the work is carried out in front of monitoring screens.
