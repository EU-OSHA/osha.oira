Sexual harassment refers to "the situation in which unwanted behaviour with a
sexual connotation, expressed physically, verbally or non-verbally, occurs
with an aim or effect which is harmful to the personal dignity of an
individual and, more specifically, creates an intimidating, hostile,
degrading, humiliating or insulting environment".

On a psychological level, sexual harassement may result in stress, anxiety,
depression, a state of nervousness, feelings of despair, impotence anger, etc.
The physical effects of sexual harassment involve sleeping and eating
disorders, headaches, nausea, high blood pressure - in fact all the symptoms
commonly associated with stress.
