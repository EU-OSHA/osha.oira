Ambient factors such as heat, cold, a lack of light, inadequate humidity, bad
ventilationÂ  must also be taken into consideration as they are the causes of
accidents, diseases and various kinds of discomfort. Intervening factors are:

\- insufficient fresh air,

\- working in bad weather conditions (in great heat or severe cold),

\- the work organisation that does not provide for the necessary means to
protect oneself against the cold or heat or in which officers are explosed to
unsuitable temperatures for excessively long periods.

\- the officer: inappropriate working clothing, etc.

The inadequate conditions listed above may cause disconfort, troubles and
illness: drowsiness, feeling of ill-being, colds.
