title: Commercial manned guarding (including shop supervisors)
---

## A retail security officer guards the premises for a retail store. Retail
security officers ensure the safety at such places as clothing stores,
electronic shops or even automobile dealerships. They guard the retail
establishment against theft, property damage and the occasional unruly
customer. And, of course, they keep a close eye on the cash register and
vault.
