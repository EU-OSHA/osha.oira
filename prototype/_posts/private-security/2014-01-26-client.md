Private security guards are in a rather special situation because they carry
out their work at the client's premises. The duties and obligations of all
parties involved have to be clearly delineated.

When workers from different companies are involved in the same working
environment, working relationships become more complex and may complicate the
coordination of activities. This may result in disorganisation, with
everything this entails in terms of accidents and confusion concerning the
tasks to be executed, etc. In these kinds of circumstances efforts must
therefore be made at company level in order to share information and to reach
an agreement on respective duties and responsibilities.These are mainly
interfering risks.

The interference risk is basically an accident risk linked to the operations
of the security company carried out within the client company. However, it
also constitutes a possible factor of uncertainty, tension and stress for
security guards to the extent that they find themselves in working
situations/contexts in which they have no knowledge of the risks resulting
from these situations, of the preventive measures to be adopted, or of the
responsibilities of the people they deal with.
