Although lone working is not prohibited under the European Directives, it
should in principle be subject to a prior risk assessment. If in the course of
the risk assessment, it transpires that the security guardÂ´s health and safety
cannot be guaranteed, lone working should be avoided. If conversely, the
assessment reveals that it is possible, the security guard must be given all
the necessary guarantees that he or she will be able to do the job in safety
and without health problems.
