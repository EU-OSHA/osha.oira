Seated postures are the most frequent ones in activities such counter or
reception work. These activities involve not only ergonomic risk, but also
risks for the sight and mental workload problems.

Risk factor are:

\- The size of the area (tool small, not enough space for legs), etc.

\- Unsuitable basic working equipment (chair, table, footrest, ...).

\- Work organisation: the tasks to be done, the time alloted for each of them

\- General and/or specific lighting

\- The security guard: bad working habits (not adjusting equipment to his or
her bodies features, etc.), bad posture habits (slightly bent back, ...).

Prolonged periods of working while sitting down may cause muscular pain in the
upper part of the back, the shoulders, arms, etc. This can be linked to a bad
postion in front of screens or monitors and can aslo lead to awkward movemtns,
trapped nerves, etc.

This kind of seated working environment is often linked to problems relating
to sedentary work (lower back pains, blood circulation disorders in the legs)
and to obesity. However, it can also cause eyestrain and other sight problems
because often the work is carried out in front of monitoring screens.
