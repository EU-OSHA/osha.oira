This category of hazards includes afflictions resulting from exposure to
physical risks such as noise, cold; to chemical hazards such as gas and other
hazardous products; and to biological hazards such as micro-organisms, cell
cultures and human endoparasites. Most of these risks are not inherent in
security activities; rather, they are connected with the client company or the
nature and characteristics of the latterâ€™s installations.
