Standing postures are frequent in static surveillance activities. Standing is
a natural posture for humans and so, in theory, does not pose any specific
health problems. However systematically working in an upright position for
considerable lenghts of time may result in health problems for the workers in
question.

Risk factors are:

\- Work organisation (break times, number of breaks, tasks to be performed)

\- The worker: bad posture habits, etc.

\- The floor covering: e.g. metal or cement floors

The fact of regularly working standing up may result in painful feet, swelling
of the legs, varicose veins, lower back pains, stiffness in the neck and
shoulder muscles and joints, a general muscular fatigue as well as other
health problems. It may even bring about a long-term degeneration of the
tendons and ligaments.
