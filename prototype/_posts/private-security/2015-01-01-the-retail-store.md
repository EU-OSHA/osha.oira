Some of the risks faced by the security guards result from the physical
environment in which the work is carried out. There are numerous safety-
related risk factors and it is vital that security staff be well aware of
them, for their own personal safety and physical wellbeing as well as those of
others.

The safety-related hazards are as follows:

\- Risk of falls, slips and trips

\- Risk of collissions, bumps and jamming

\- Risk of electrical accidents

\- Riks of fire
