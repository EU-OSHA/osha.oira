Stress is a state, which is accompanied by physical, psychological or social
complaints or dysfunctions and which results from individuals feeling unable
to bridge a gap with the requirements or expectations placed on them.

The individual is well adapted to cope with short-term exposure to pressure,
which can be considered as positive, but has greater difficulty in coping with
prolonged exposure to intensive pressure. Moreover, different individuals can
react differently to similar situations and the same individual can react
differently to similar situations at different times of his/her life.

Stress is not a disease but prolonged exposure to it may reduce effectiveness
at work and may cause ill health. Stress originating outside the working
environment can lead to changes in behaviour and reduced effectiveness at
work. All manifestations of stress at work cannot be considered as work-
related stress. Work-related stress can be caused by different factors such as
work content, work organisation, work environment, poor communication, etc.
