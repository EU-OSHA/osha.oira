For obvious reasons, there is a high risk of physical and verbal agression in
the sector. There is a wide range of situations in which acts of physical and
verbal agression are committed against officers. Security personnel are listed
as being among the occupational groups most likely to be exposed to acts of
physical and verbal aggression.

The intervening factors:

\- Characteristics of the workplace: very busy (shopping centre), ..

\- The possibility to communicate immediately or rapidly with other people
(co-workers, police, one´s company, etc.).

\- Features of the workstation: contacts with the public, etc.

\- The assaillant(s) (delinquents, clients, users, ...): number, physical
features, whether or not they are armed, etc.

\- The officer: training and experience in dealing with these kinds of
situations, his/her reactions, excess/lack of confidence, etc.

The nature and seriousness of injuries may vary considerably depending on the
nature of the attack: light injuries (superficial lesions, blows and light
traumas), serious injuries (serious traumas requiring surgery), death.

In addition to these injuries, physical attacks may also wreak other negative
effects on workers´ health: increased stress and general deterioration in
health; reduced phychosocial wellbeing; low self-esteem; lack of job
satisfaction and motivation; reaction of fear; post-traumatic stress.
