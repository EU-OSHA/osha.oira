Noise is a habitual factor in the workplace. Although most of the time there
is no risk of loss of hearing, it may cause considerable damage. Noise need
not be excessively loud to cause problems in the workplace.

The intervening factors are:

\- The ambient noise in the workplace (noise of the building installations,
noise of machinery, of office equipment, noise caused by human beings, crowds,
etc.).

\- The workerÂ´s attitude towards noise: if the worker is not happy in his
work, he will be more sensitive to noise oi in any case perceive it as a
disturbing factor.

\- The job: the noise will be all the more disturbing if it interferes with
the job or if the latter is very complex.

The effects of noise on the human hearing depends on the level as well as on
the duration of exposure. The effects of noise can be highly diverse, which is
why it is difficult to predict the impact it may have on an individual or a
group of people. The most common effects include physiological (headaches,
loss of hearing or even deafness) or even psychological impairment (loss of
concentration, nervousness). It may also be a source of work-related stress
and increased risk of accidents.
