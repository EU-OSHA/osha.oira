Mental workload denotes all of the tensions experienced by workers which are
specific to the mental demands of the job (perception and processing of
information, cognitive processes involved in memorization, reasoning, problem-
solving, etc.).

In terms of task requirements, information processing tasks require the
following from the security guard:

\- attention

\- concentration

\- coordination

The mental workload of tasks to be performed also depends on other factors
such as:

\- the guard´s responsibility vis-à-vis co-workers, the client

\- duration of the activity (working hours, breaks)

\- danger (possible assaults, etc.).

Situations of excessive or insuficient mental workload can have negative
impact on health: tension, stress, sense of monotony, mental fatigue, general
tiredness, etc. Mental and nervous fatigue are generally associated with
short-term absenteeism (tiredness, muscular pains, headaches, digestion
problems). They can also have an effect on the worker´s emotional state
(irritability, sadness) and behaviour (alcohol abuse and/or smoking,
agressiveness, etc.).
