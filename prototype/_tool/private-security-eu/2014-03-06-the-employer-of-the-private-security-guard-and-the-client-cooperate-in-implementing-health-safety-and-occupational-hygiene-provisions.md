When people from different companies are involved in the same working
environment, working relationships become more complex and may complicate the
coordination of activities. This may result in disorganisation, with
everything this entails in terms of accidents and confusion concerning the
tasks to be executed, ... In these kinds of circumstances efforts must
therefore be made at company level in order to **share information** and to
**reach an agreement on respective duties and responsibilities**.

Agreements on the following topics could be signed:

  * **working circumstances**, clarifying the roles, obligations and responsibilities of the employer, the client and the worker
  * the companies' **emergency protocols**, setting up the responsibilities and obligations of the client, the employer and the worker with respect to the emergency situations at the workplace
  * **personal protective equipment**: protective clothing, other garment and equipment designed to protect worker's health from the risks present at the workplace
  * periodic checks and maintenance of all **work equipment** by the client
  * **house rules:** discussions are prevented from arising during implementation through having paid attention to house rules in the contracts.
