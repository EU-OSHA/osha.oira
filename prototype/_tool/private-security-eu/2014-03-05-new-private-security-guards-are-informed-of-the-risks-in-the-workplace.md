In order to work in complete safety and/or in the right conditions, private
security guards need to **be properly informed**. It is the employer's
obligation to inform the private security guards about the occupational
hazards related to their activity.

Information provided to private security guards must include health and safety
risks, but also all the measures adopted by the company to deal with these
risks in each type of job, assignment or function.
