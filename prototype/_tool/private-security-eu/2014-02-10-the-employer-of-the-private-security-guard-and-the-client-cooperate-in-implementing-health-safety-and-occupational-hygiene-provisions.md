therefore be made at company level in order to **share information** and to
**reach an agreement on respective duties and responsibilities**.

  * **working circumstances**, clarifying the roles, obligations and responsibilities of the employer, the client and the worker
  * the companies' **emergency protocols**, setting up the responsibilities and obligations of the client, the employer and the worker with respect to the emergency situations at the workplace
  * **personal protective equipment**: protective clothing, other garment and equipment designed to protect worker's health from the risks present at the workplace
