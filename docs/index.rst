Introduction
============

The OiRA risk assessment tool is based on hierarchical questionnaires. A
questionnaire (or OIRA tool) covers all possible risks for a specific sector of
industry.

Each sector organisation can have one or more OiRA tools published simultaneously.
In order to facilitate development and testing of OIRA tools the system supports
multiple versions for a OiRA tools. Only a single version of an OiRA tool can be public
at any point in time.
